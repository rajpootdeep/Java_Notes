You can set Java-specific memory limits or other JVM options when running the JAR:

java -Xmx512M -Xms128M -jar your-application.jar
-Xmx512M sets the maximum heap size to 512 MB.
-Xms128M sets the initial heap size to 128 MB.



Memory Leaks

When you get an outOfMemory exception on your app, there are two distinct possibilities : 
1. Insufficient memory given to the application(Capacity problem)
2. A true memory leak(more and more memory consumption as time passes without release of resources) 

-XLoggc : redirects GC output to file instead of console

----------------------------------------- JVM JRE JIT ClassLoader -----------------------------------------------------------------

ClassLoader - it is integral part of JRE, which loads the java classes dynamically during execution when JVM request for class.


Javac -  convert source code to Bytecode(Platform independent)

JVM Intepreter - Intepret the bytecode at runtime

HostsPots -JVM continuously monitor the execution of program and identify frequently executed code.
JIT(Just-In-Time) - When a hotspot is detected, the JIT compiler compiles the corresponding bytecode into native machine code for the 		    underlying hardware platform.his compilation process is performed on-the-fly.

java -XX:+PrintCompilation -version  - prints logs for JIT

JDK = Development Tools + JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
JRE = Libraries for running the application + JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
JVM = Only the runtime environment that helps in executing the Java bytecode.
